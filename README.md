# Calories Health Tracker

A single-page web application built using the Backbone and Firebase, that tracks the user's calorie intake. 
Users can search for food items provided by the Nutritionix API and select them. Once they are selected, 
they will be added to the list of foods the user is tracking. The total calorie count will also update to 
reflect the new daily total.
